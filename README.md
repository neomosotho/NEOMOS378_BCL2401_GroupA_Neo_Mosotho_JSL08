# [JSL08] Submission: Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management


## Singleton Explanation:

A Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. For our banking system, let's use the Singleton pattern to manage the bank's branch information.

Design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer can significantly improve the structure and maintainability of your JavaScript projects, making your code cleaner and more efficient. By understanding and applying these patterns, you'll be well-equipped to tackle complex design challenges in your projects, just as a well-organized bank efficiently manages its operations and services.

## Overview:
In this project, I was required to use the singleton pattern for a Bannk Branch Management. I was given instructions to follow as I coded, in order to complete this project.

## Feedback:
Overall, this project was fun and interesting as I was able to learn new features and challenge myself. 

## Technologies used:
In this project I only used html, css and javascript.

## Challenges:
At first I had trouble understanding Singleton instances, which I am still working on. But overall, with the instructions given and the resources as well, I managed to complete the project. I must say though, I need to practice singleton instances more so that I can understand them even better.
